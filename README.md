# PigiTube :

## Dependance

This app uses [PyQt5](#PyQt5) for the GUI (Grapiqual User Interface), [Pytube](#Pytube) for downloading streams from youtube, and [FFmpeg](#FFMPEG), for all the conversion and that kind of stuff.  
I only own the code from PigiTube.py, as my [License](license) says.

## What is this ?

This is an application to download YouTube videos, with a simple GUI for personnal use ONLY.
I am not responsible for your actions.

# **Install**

## With the standAlone (only window confirmed)

Only works with window, or maybe MAC/linux with WINE but Idk..
If you live at the time of the dinosaurs and you still have a pc on windows 7, choose the addequate executable, same for the users of windows 10, It on the StandAlone_Installer folder ( not yet D: ).

## With Python (all platform)

You will need Python 3.8+ and Pip in the PATH.  
First we are going to get the repertory on github and with the following command : Open the command prompt into your folder and type :

```
git clone https://github.com/Pigi-bytes/Youtube_download.git
cd  Youtube_download
```

Now, we have downloaded the app, and we are inside...  
 This is the right time to create a venv
known as Virtual Environment. It will allow you to keep your python file clean and have specific versions for your pip paquetages.  
We create a Venv with the following command :

```
py -m venv .\venv 
```

All this is good but it must be activated, so we run this command :

```
venv\scripts\activate
```

We can download the different modules that we will need in the venv:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And for launching the app you will need to type this ( when you are into the venv)

```
py youtube_download.py 
```

## To sum up :

Setup :

```
git clone https://github.com/Pigi-bytes/Youtube_download.git
cd  Youtube_download
py -m venv ./venv 
venv/scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

From now on you just have to execute these two commands to make it work (on the folder):

```
venv/scripts/activate
py youtube_download.py 
```

# Use

You must enter the url of your video in the field provided for this purpose,Â this url must be submitted in the form as :

> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxxxxxxxxxx  
> Where xxxxxxxxxxx is the ID of the video.  
> 
> All other urls from youtube are not supported :  
> (mobile URL, URL with time, a video into a playlist)

Then you have to click on the button 'ok' next to it. Wait for a  few seconds, the thumbnail and the title should be displayed to confirm that the desired video is indeed the correct one.

If you only want audio, activate the small checkbox, it will only download the audio track : this will be in the form of an .mp3 file : otherwise it will be the video (by default) and a .mp4 file.

***WARNING : If the title contains characters which are not supported, the file will be renamed, without the problematic character. And if a file already has the name of the video in the downloading folder, a prefix will be added.***

After that you have to choose the place where it should be downloaded, and wait for the bip...

# Download

**The speed will depend on your internet connection (downward flow) and the speed of your hardware.**

It should also be noted that the download takes longer depending on the type of media to download : 

## For audio only :

---

The application will download the best audio quality of your video, in the .mp4 format ( Which just contains the codecs / channels for the audio, and no video, juste a black background ).

It will save it under a different name from the final one, to ensure compatibility with our conversion software,into a temporary folder.  

> Temp\FFMPEG_compatible.mp4

Then our post-processing conversion software [FFMPEG](#FFMPEG) will take care of converting our file into .mp3, it is for this that a console appears for a few seconds so we end up with:

> Temp\FFMPEG_compatible.mp4  
> Temp\FFMPEG_compatible.mp3

We delete the file which ends with .mp4, and we rename the one that ends with .mp3, with the right file name (without special characters and with a suffix if necessary), our temp folder now looks like this:

> Temp\YourAudioWithoutSpecialChracterSuffixe.mp3  

And finally we copy it to the place you choose.

## For video :

---

The application will download the best audio quality of your video, in the .mp4 format ( Which just contains the codecs / channels for the audio, and no video, just a black background ).

It will save it under a different name from the final one, to ensure compatibility with our conversion software, into a temporary folder.  

> Temp\audio.mp4

After the application will check to see what video quality is obtainable :  
By default it will stop at 1080p, to save bandwidth, but you can change it in the code.  
If it does not find the 1080p quality it will take the highest available (below 1080p).  
Its gonna take some time, (again it depends on the size of the video and your internet connection (downward flow))  
Its going to be saved, in the temporary folder, under the name 'video.mp4', because yes it is an mp4 file, but without the audio channels, because youtube uses a processor called [DASH](#DASH) (see below).

So now we end up with 2 files in the temporary folder:

> Temp\audio.mp4  
> Temp\video.mp4

The post processing software, [FFMPEG](#FFMPEG),  will then copy the audio track ON the video and render it, and TADAM we have our FullHD 1080x1920 60fps video, its name is 'final.mp4'.
The temporay folder will look like this :

> Temp\audio.mp4  
> Temp\video.mp4  
> Temp\final.mp4

So we delete audio.mp4, video.mp4 and rename final.mp4 with the right file name (without special characters and with a suffix if necessary) and now we have :

> Temp\YourVideoWithoutSpecialChracterSuffixe.mp4 

We copy that where you want i t to be, and it is done. X

# CODECS_&_Formats

## Format output

The application allows you to download videos in :

- Audio format (.mp3)
- Video format (.mp4)

## Audio CODECS

The codecs for the audio are [AAC mpga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding) 

## Video CODECS

- Flux 0 (video)
  
    The codecs for the video are [AV1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1), these codecs are supported by [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) thanks to their decoder [DaV1d](https://www.videolan.org/projects/dav1d.html).  
  
  - You are watched by Bill Gate: 
    
    - For windows 7:
      - Install the codec AV1 (use google)
      - Use [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)
    - For windows 10:
      - Install the codec AV1 on the microsoft store [Beta for AV1 video codec](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MVZQVXJBQ9V)
      - Use the godam [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)
  
  - if you have an Apple or a Penguin as an OS :
    
    - Use [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)
    - There are probably other options, but I don't have the money for a mac 
      and especially never will I use this horrible OS.
    - I have too little experience with penguin OS to talk about it, I'm sure if I say something wrong about it, they'll find me and beat me up with metal pipes.

- flux 1 (audio)
  
  - For the audio flux we use the same audio codec as quoted recently, [AAC mpga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding) 

## Warning :

I am not an expert in codecs, and I have about a 45 minutes reading on the internet so don't believe me literally, you can always convert them to other codecs with better a support, but as far as I have read, AV1 is the future.

# DASH

The youtubes videos come in different streams, some containing only the audio stream, other than the video stream and some both.  
This is because YouTube supports a streaming technique called [DASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP) known by the sweet name of *Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP*.  
It coexists with another technique, which is called [progressive download](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_download).  
While [DASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP) specializes in high quality streams, [progressive download](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_download) deals with lower quality streams, like 720p or below, this last technique contains both audio and video stream.  
For [DASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP), the quality is not limited, but we need to download each stream, audio and video, before merging them with post processing software (in our case, [FFMPEG](#FFMPEG)

# FFMPEG

Shamefully steal from their website :

> [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the cutting edge. No matter if they were designed by some standards committee, the community or a corporation. It is also highly portable: [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) compiles, runs, and passes our testing infrastructure FATE across Linux, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, the BSDs, Solaris, etc. under a wide variety of build environments, machine architectures, and configurations.

To download [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org) : [It's here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) and it's a blessing from the lord, use it.  
On this project, we use it to convert .mp4 to .mp3 and to assemble 2 tracks (one with only sound and one with only video) : see [Download](#Download)   
See [License](#License) for more information about them.

# PyQt5

It is a module which allows you to handle the high level API [Qt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)), written in C++ with python, thanks to this, we can make rather pretty graphical interfaces compared to Tkinter.  
See [License](#License) for more information about them.

# Pytube

Then Pytube, alalala~ the cornerstone, the foundation, of my application : it's a python module that takes care of fetching youtube videos. It takes care of downloading the video, choosing the quality and all.  
We can find the official depot of this API masterpiece like always on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pytube/).  
Their [documentation](https://pytube.io/en/latest/index.html) is incredibly incredible and helps me a lot.
